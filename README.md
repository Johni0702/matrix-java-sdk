# Matrix Client SDK for Java
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kamax-io/matrix-java-sdk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kamax-io/matrix-java-sdk)

Matrix SDK in Java 1.8 for:
- Client -> Identity Server
- Application Server -> Homeserver

**WARNING:** This SDK was originally created to support [Kamax.io projects](https://github.com/kamax-io) and is therefore not necessarly complete. It will be built as the various projects evolve and grow. The SDK is therefore still in Alpha.

Contributions and PRs are welcome to turn this into a fully fledged Matrix Java SDK.
